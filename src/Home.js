                My name is Ty Crenshaw and I am a 33-year-old software developer at Link Trust, a company that provides online marketing solutions. I have been working there for over two years, using the .NET Framework with an MVC front end and a MySQL database. I enjoy learning new things and keeping up with the latest technologies, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. In my spare time, I like to play video games with my wife, mainly Overwatch, and go on walks with her. I also have some hobbies like hiking and climbing, but I donâ€™t do them as often as I used to. My goals are to improve my skills and knowledge as a developer, and to find new opportunities and challenges that can help me grow professionally and personally.
