                <p>I develop and maintain in-house projects that offer affiliate marketing services to other businesses. Affiliate marketing is a type of online marketing where affiliates earn commissions for referring customers or leads to a business. My projects provide tools for tracking, reporting, analytics, lead generation, and more to help my clients improve their marketing strategies and results.</p>

                <p>I use Jira as my project management tool to keep track of tasks, features, bugs, and progress. I follow the agile methodology to deliver software in short and iterative cycles. I have daily stand-up meetings with my team to share what I have done, what I plan to do, and what challenges I face. I also have weekly sizing meetings with my team and stakeholders to estimate the effort and complexity of future features, and prioritize them according to the clientâ€™s needs and expectations.</p>

                <p>One of my most challenging projects was the partner sign-up project. The goal was to create a customizable sign-up page for each client that allows them to collect different information from their affiliates based on their requirements. Some of the challenges that I faced were handling a lot of variation and validation for each field, ensuring security and privacy of the data, and integrating with other systems or services. Some of the solutions that I came up with were creating a configurable interface for each client that allows them to specify what fields they want to include in their sign-up page, using standard hashing algorithms to encrypt sensitive data. Some of the outcomes or benefits of my project were increasing the conversion rate of affiliates, improving the user experience of the sign-up process, and enhancing the Client satisfaction.</p>
